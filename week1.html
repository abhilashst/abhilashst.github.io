                <br><h3>Day 1 </h3>
                    <p>On the very  first day of pre fab training, our instructor Francisco Sanchez Arroyo gave us  an introduction about fablabs and the necessity of making things ourselves through his simple presentation. 
In between he shared the google drive folder for all the participants which is to be used for storing and sharing files.</p>
<p>
He was talking about the companies which manufacture products massively of different colors and shapes since the taste of an individual cannot be separately identified which in turn results in  a heap of wastage. Hw it would be that one could  make almost everything that he needed by himself and thus can avoid the wastage of resources? this sounds cool  right ?
 that's the real motive of the fablabs.</p><p>
 Then we discussed about  the importance of pre fab training and how it will help us in fab academy . 
Franc then discussed about the 9 principles at MIT Media lab and gave a relaxation session ,so that we can have a fresh start.then he explained about the fab academy courses and  the importance of time and effort to come out with flying colours.


 Franc explained us about the mailing list and  things we should take care while sending mails and replies.</p><p>



How to ask properly another important factor when it comes to troubleshooting and bug fixing. Usually people  say it doesn't works or it gave me an error. Even if someone wants to help us they cannot do the same when we ask like that. Franc clearly explained the solution for this.
 Later he showed us the fab academy archives and documentations of previous students. then franc mentioned about neil, sherry and explained their tasks, roles etc. Also explained about the evaluation process and review that is going to happen on every wednesday 9 am @ Boston.
He gave a clear idea on relevance of our final project also lectured us on  what a good final project is.

A good project must be simple,sellable and must solve some problem. I like to simplify it as <b> 3 S </b>.

There are  three types of final projects according to Franc.
<ul><li>The good: Simple, well crafted
</li><li>The vague: Overcomplicated, does not solve any problem</li>
<li>The bad: Poorly documented, horrible aspect</li></ul>



and we winded up for the day. </p>


<h2>Day 2 </h2>

<h3>Preparing Laptops and Lab Computers</h3><br>

We had to start with preparing our Laptops and Computer for using fab modules and othe software required for fab academy. For that i need to install the latest LTS version of Ubuntu which is Ubuntu LTS 14.04.
<br>
To install latest Ubuntu Desktop LTS (currently 14.04).<br>

Formatted one of my drives and prepared the drive.It was a 100 gb drive and deleted the partiotion. Started Installation using a bootable pendrive containing Ubuntu Desktop LTS (currently 14.04). Using the disk management tool created on 50Gb partition for root and 40 gb for home and allocated the remaining for Swap Area. <br> <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/343268/how-to-use-manual-partitioning-during-installation">(Find th Detailed Installation Guide here)</a><br>
And it was completed successfully. Now my Lap is a multi booting lap with Windows 10 and Linux. I am a linux user from my school times. <br>Every time after the Linux installation what I do at first is customising the grub background. I hate the plain boot screen background. I don't know why. :).

Here is how I changed  grub Background image. <br>
First download the required background: <br>
and paste the image into boot/grub folder which demand superuser acces.
for that type the following in terminal. <br>
 <pre><code class="language-css">$ sudo nautilus</code></pre> <br>
enter password <br>
navigate to boot/grub <br>
 Paste the image there. Again back to terminal <br>
 <pre><code class="language-css">$ sudo update-grub</code></pre> <br>

That's it!. Next time when you boot your system you can see the image you selected as your boot screen background. <br><br>


<img src="images/desktop.png" width="840px" height="450px">

<p style=" text-align:center;  ">Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop  after sucessful Install</p><br>

Next Franc showed how to install software using Ubuntu software center and how to install software using apt-get. I was familiar with those , so I started to install the required programs from the list which Franc shared.

<h3>1.Adding “Terminal here” addon for Nautilus.</h3> <br>

Code for that. <br>

 <pre><code class="language-css">sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nautilus-open-terminal
sudo apt-get install nautilus-actions</code></pre>
Then we have to quit Nautilus, for that type the following command:
  <pre><code class="language-css">$ sudo nautilus -q</code></pre> <br>

After that when we restarted nautilus and right clicked we had that open in terminal option.
 <br>

<img src="images/terminalhere.png" width="840px" height="450px">

<p style=" text-align:center;  ">Terminal Here Window</p><br>



<h3>2. Installing fab modules compiled version</h3> <br>
 To install Fab Modules Compiled version Franc shared this url http://kokompe.cba.mit.edu/ .
Procedures are as follow.
Download Fab Modules zip from the link. http://kokompe.cba.mit.edu/fab_src.zip
Unzip the downloaded file
Install the dependencies using this single code

  <pre><code class="language-css">$ sudo apt-get install python python-wxgtk2.8 python-dev python-pip gcc g++ libpng12-dev libgif-dev make bash okular libboost-thread-dev libboost-system-dev cmake</code></pre>
  After that open the unzipped folder, then right click and select open terminal . then type the following command.

<pre><code class="language-css">$ make fab </code></pre>
then 
<pre><code class="language-css">$  sudo make install </code></pre>

At this point, make install will copy all executables and scripts to /usr/local/bin.

After that you can run Fab Modules from terminal by typing fab.


<h3>3. Installing Kokopelli retro.</h3> <br>

we have to install kokopelli retro  for editing Neil’s circuit boards. Kokopelli is one amazing software for creating circuit boards, 2d designs.<br>
 How to install?<br>

Download zip from this link.
Unzip the folder
Open folder in terminal
follow the codes.
<pre><code class="language-css">$  make fab </code></pre>

<img src="images/koko.png" width="840px" height="450px">

<p style=" text-align:center;  ">Kokopelli Window after sucessful Install</p><br>



<h3>4. Installing Antimony</h3> <br>
 <p>Installing Antimony is lengthy process and it consumed some time for me. First we need to install all the dependencies.Here is the whole step i followed for installing Antimony in Ubuntu 14.04.

Step 1. Install Qt : <br>Download Qt from here and right click on the downloaded file and set permision to run as executable file. Then double click on the file and continue the install.
Step 2.Run the following code in terminal to install other reqiured dependencies.<br>

<pre><code class="language-css">$   sudo apt-get install build-essential libpng-dev python3-dev libboost-all-dev libgl1-mesa-dev lemon flex </code></pre>

Step 3. 14.04 ships with gcc 4.8, you'll need to update the compiler manually:

<pre><code class="language-css">
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-4.9 g++-4.9
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.9
</code></pre>

Step 4. Clone the Github repo to your pc 

<pre><code class="language-css">$   git clone https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony </code></pre>

Step 5. Change Directory

<pre><code class="language-css">$  cd antimony </code></pre>

Step 6.Make Directory Build

<pre><code class="language-css">$  mkdir build</code></pre>
Step 7. Change Dirctory Build

<pre><code class="language-css">$   cd build </code></pre>

Step 8.If you installed another version of Qt change the link appropriately.(I renamed the folder in home to Qt and version i installed is 5.5)

<pre><code class="language-css">$   ~/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake ../sb.pro</code></pre>


Step 9. Make 


<pre><code class="language-css">$   make -j8</code></pre>

Step 10. Install App

<pre><code class="language-css">$   sudo make install </code></pre>
Step 11. Open App

<pre><code class="language-css">$   ./app/antimony</code></pre>

Errors i got after installing Antimony.
 Whenever i try to add a 2d image after opening Antimony the app was crashing. It was since i missed step 3 in updating gcc.
 <blockquote>If antimony crashes while trying add a component even after a successfull install. Update gcc from step 3.</blockquote>

I am used to Sublime text so i downloaded sublime.
 






<h2>Day 3 </h2>
<h3>Creating accounts</h3>
 <br>
On Day 3 our first task was to create the following account and write down all the links. 
These are  recommended for fab academy so that we can organize and store our data and files and synchronize everything. <br>
<ul>
<li>Fablabs.io Account</li>
<li>git.fabcloud.io Account </li>
<li>Google account</li>
<li> Youtube and/or Vimeo account</li>
<li>Dropbox account</li>
<li> Sketchfab.com account</li> </ul>

I skipped Google, Dropbox, Youtube account creation since I already have those.
I started with git.fabclouds.io and signed up for an account. I refreshed my inbox thrice for the confirmation email.


                    <blockquote>Always Check your Spam folder for Confirmation mail from git.fabclouds.io.</blockquote><br>
                    <p>

Link to my Fab Cloud Account <a href="http://git.fabcloud.io/u/abhilashst1 "> http://git.fabcloud.io/u/abhilashst1 </a> <br>
Next I created Fablabs.io Account: Link <a href="https://www.fablabs.io/users/4693 " >https://www.fablabs.io/users/4693 </a><br>
Sketchfab Account : <a href="https://sketchfab.com/abhilashst1 ">

https://sketchfab.com/abhilashst1 </a></p>
 <br>


<h3>Creating Github Repositories</h3> <br>

GIT is the most accomplished  distributed version control system. It helps us to manage our  own project locally using a version control tool or if we want  modify a code that is located in a remote central GIT repository. <br>

<b>Installing and Configuring Git.</b> <br>

  <pre><code class="language-css">$sudo apt-get install git </code></pre> <br>

The next  step is to specify your username and email address to your GIT repository using “git config” as shown below.


  <pre><code class="language-css">git config --global user.name "username"

git config --global user.email email@email.com
 </code></pre> <br>

Verify the git configuration information as shown below. <br>


  <pre><code class="language-css"> $ git config --list

 </code></pre> <br>

Create a repository in Github for  personal website

Head over to GitHub and create a new repository named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.
If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right. <br>

 Clone the created repo to our PC.

 <pre><code class="language-css">$ git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io

 </code></pre> <br>

Move to that folder and create index.html and some content. Now we need to push this.  <br>
Add, commit, and push your changes: <br>
 <pre><code class="language-css">
$ git add --all
#adding files
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
#Adding Comments
$ git push -u origin master
# pushing
 </code></pre> <br>

<b>Creating SSH Keys.</b> <br>

SSH keys are used to identify computers, it helps in pushing easy without  passwords.
Before creating one we need to check for exixting ssh key.
For that type the code below in terminal. <br>

 <pre><code class="language-css">
ls -al ~/.ssh
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist

 </code></pre> <br>

<b>Generate a new SSH key</b> <br>
With Terminal still open, copy and paste the text below.Don't forget to change the email address to your login email id for github. <br>
 <pre><code class="language-css">
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

 </code></pre> <br>

Go with the default settings, skip paraphrase.I added a paraphrase which made my ssh configuring that not aading any advantage.So  i created new ssh key withoout paraphrase and then configured it to github. <br>
Ensure ssh-agent is enabled:
 <pre><code class="language-css">
# start the ssh-agent in the background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
# Agent pid 59566
 </code></pre> <br>
Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent:
 <pre><code class="language-css">
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

 </code></pre> <br>


<b>Add your SSH key to your account</b> <br><br>
Copy the SSH key to your clipboard. For that type the following code in terminal.This will install xclip first and then copies the key to clipboard. <br>
<pre><code class="language-css">

$ sudo apt-get install xclip
# Downloads and installs xclip.

xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# For copying  the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to clipboard
 </code></pre> <br>

Now login to github account from browser, navigate to account settings by click on profile photo and clicking on Settings. <br>
On the left  settings sidebar, click SSH keys. <br>
Click Add SSH key. <br>
Give name in the description field so that you can understand the device. <br>
Paste key into the "Key" field. <br>
Click Add key. <br>
That's all folk Github is configured using ssh. Now we can push to your rep  very easily.




<h3>Documenting Fab Academy and Pre Academy</h3>

Next Franc talked about the importance of documentation. According to him it's all about documentation. HE told us to tell our story in documentation not a step by step tutorial.Familiarity with HTML will help us in documenting since we need to dump all our data into an HTML website. Then he shared some links to  <a href=”https://www.edx.org/course/html5-part-1-html5-coding-essentials-w3cx-html5-1x>”learn HTML </a>, and link to <a href=”http://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/ 
”>download free bootstrap templates</a>. Also he shared the link to the grading criteria and final project requirements in Fab Academy.  <br><br>
Link to Fab Academy 2015 Evaluation Checklist  <br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v3GzwGlI4TFND0PUZPv_1FMEWwciLfFZj8WpypcbdFI/edit?usp=sharing">Click Here</a> <br>

<h3>Photography. </h3> <br>


Franc then told us about the importance of photography in Documentation Process. The size of the image should be in correct resolution that will not increase website loading time or reduce quality. I prefer to you 800 * 600 px images. I am familiar with photoshop so that i created a Action to resize all the images captured and screenshots to the required size. While taking images we should be careful to avoid blur.Franc told us about rule of thirds and how we should focus images and where to place images. Also we must be perfect in selecting the background for the images.We must not select very colorful  background, always do minimalist and give importance to what you people to notice at first. The lighting is another important thing to take of while doing photography for documentation. If we can create the scene it will be more nice and appealing for the viewers.
<h3>Creating Mockups</h3> <br>
 Mockups are very useful  for final project presentation or interface application since it can give an attractive appearance to our product. Franc shared this link where we can create Mockups . <br>

<h3>Principles of good design</h3> <br>

<ul>

<li> Simplicity </li><li> Typography</li><li>  Color harmony</li>
</ul>



<h2>Day 4</h2><br>
        <br>

Day 4 was dedicated for cleaning and setting up lab and also for learning time management through the same. Before starting cleaning Franc gave an overview of Time management. He explained how supply and demand and linked. Later he explained about the importance of parallel development. Usually all of us go for serial development we will wait for one process to complete and do the other. Franc gave an idea of creating time slots and how to try to stick to that time slot. Also he taught us how to do things parallely which will help in rapid prototyping.<br><br>

<h3>Preparing the lab</h3>

The first task was cleaning up the lab. He allotted separate sections for each of us. He said that we must stick to our section first and later finishing that we can help others. I was given the Laser Cutter section to clean up. The area where we placed Laser cutter was really messed up with a lot things that doesn't belongs to laser cutting. I started with moving  things  that doesn't belongs to laser cutter to their respective places. After that i moved used acrylic and cardboard to the inventory. The i arranged the Desk where computer for laser and also organised the laser cut model in a box. also cleaned the dust in the desk and below the tables.<br><br>

After that i helped in organising one Soldering Desk along with arranging Electronics inventory section.<br><br>
