                <h2 class="section-heading">Week 1 </h2>
                    <p>On the very  first day of pre fab training, Our instructor Francisco Sanchez Arroyo gave us  an introduction about fablabs and the necessity of making things ourselves through his simple presentation. 
In between he shared the google drive folder for all the participants which is to be used for storing and sharing files.</p>
<p>
he was talking about the companies which manufacture products massively of different colors and shapes since the taste of an individual cannot be separately identified which in turn results in  a heap of wastage. how it would be that one could  make almost everything that he needed by himself and thus can avoid the wastage of resources? this sounds cool right ?
 that's the real motive of the fablabs.</p><p>
 then we discussed about  the importance of pre fab training and how it will help us in fab academy . 
Franc then discussed about the 9 principles at MIT Media lab and gave a relaxation session ,so that we can have a fresh start.then he explained about the fab academy courses and  the importance of time and effort to come out with flying colours


 franc explained us about the mailing list and  things we should take care while sending mails and replies.</p><p>

i used to work for a company before there also i had created troubles while selected between reply and reply all :P

how to be professional is another important factor when it comes to troubleshooting and bug fixing. usually people  say it doesn't works or it gave me an error. even if someone wants to help us they cannot do the same when we ask like that. Franc clearly explained the solution for this.
 later he showed us the fab academy archives and documentations of previous students. then franc mentioned about neil, sherry and explained their tasks, roles etc. Also explained about the evaluation process and review that is going to happen on every wednesday 9 am @ Boston.
he gave a clear idea on relevance of our final project also lectured us on  what a good final project is.

A good project must be simple,sellable and must solve some problem. I like to simplify it as  3 S  :D 

The three types of final projects
The good. Simple, well crafted
The vague. Overcomplicated, does not solve any problem
The bad. poorly documented, horrible aspect

and we winded up for the day. </p>
